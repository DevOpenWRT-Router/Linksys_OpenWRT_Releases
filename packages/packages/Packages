Description:  libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the
 terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and
 (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other
 sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
 strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include
 statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability
 to a program using a simple API.
 
 The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser
 library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use
 and quick to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg
 before, but was changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.

Description:  libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. it moves the common
 tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a
 library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.
 
 The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to
 evdev devices, thus making direct access unnecessary.
